Overview:
Push_swap is a program that sorts a stack of integers with the minimum instructions possible and an auxiliary stack. Instructions are defined within the subject of the project; They're the only way allowed to manipulate the data in the stacks.

checker is a utility program that, taking the same arguments as push_swap and its outputted instructions, checks if the stack ends up sorted, thus verifying if push_swap is correctly sorting the stack
