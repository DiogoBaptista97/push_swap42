### Overview:
_Push_swap_ is a program that sorts a stack of integers with the minimum instructions possible and an auxiliary stack.
Instructions are defined within the subject of the project; They're the only way allowed to
manipulate the data in the stacks.

_checker_ is a utility program that, taking the same arguments as _push_swap_ and its outputted 
instructions, checks if the stack ends up sorted, thus verifying if _push_swap_ is correctly sorting the stack

#### Makefile Available Targets:  
`make` or `make all` - Makes _push_swap_   
`make clean` - Deletes all the resulting object files   
`make fclean` - Deletes _push_swap_ and _checker_  
`make re` - fclean + all
